Description: Anomaly detection in time series data. Contains fast and easy to
    use C++ implementation of Robust Principal Component Pursuit, which is used
    to decompose a time series into a smooth component, a noise component, and
    a sparse component of anomalies. This package will grow to serve other
    types of anomalies, such as anomalies in histograms and curves.
