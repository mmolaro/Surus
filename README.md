# About
A fork of Netflix's RAD code in their Surus package focusing on the R code. Ignoring the Apache PIG or Java versions.

You can also install the anomaly detection R package trivially with this code

    library(devtools)
    install_github(repo = "mmolaro/Surus", subdir = "src/RAD")

I wrote a blog post about this project subject available at:  [http://probdist.com/netflix-anomaly-detection/](http://probdist.com/netflix-anomaly-detection/) 

The blog post covers the code on a practical and conceptual basis and would be a good place to start for people looking to use it for the first time.
